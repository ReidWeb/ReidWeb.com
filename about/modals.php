        <h4>Bash</h4>
        <p>I have utilised bash to 'automate' a number of systems on both my Linux server and laptop. While Bash may not neccessarily be viewed as a 'programming' language, the automated systems that it is enabled me to develop have been extremely useful.</p>
        <h5>Server MOTD Script</h5>
        <p>One of my earliest uses of Bash was to develop a dynamically generated 'Message of the Day' script for my Linux server. I wanted a means by which I could easily view the 'health' of the system when logging in over SSH; as such I developed a script that displayed information such as the disk and CPU usage of the system when logging in.</p>
        <p>The script is open sourced under the MIT license and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ReidWeb/linuxmotd" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h5>Build Process Automation</h5>
        <p>I have utilized bash scripting to automate processes that are completed when building a project using my Jenkins build server. I have written a number of different scripts to automate tasks such as: generating Javadocs for each branch of a git repository and copy them to a web-accessable directory and automatically 'mirroring' a git repository to another remote server when a build is triggered.</p>
